/**
 Connection which handles all read and write operations on the bluetooth connection.
 Read and write ops are dispatched to a serial queue, which should execute the given 
 closures in order or at least wait, till one operation has finished. So no concurrent 
 access on the streams should happen.
 
 TODOS:
 - Connection seems to disconnect, if a large number of messages will arrive. Dont know
 if the problem is on the ev3 side, or a problem in the ios app
 
 - responses arrive sometimes too late - that means, if a command (with reply) was send, first no reply is read on the input stream (you can send the messages, also more than once). Than you send a message without reply, and the response will arrive. Very strange.
 
 - Sometimes the first command is executed twice, but it is definitly send only once by this app
